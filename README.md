# Overview

Adapted from [jimpick/dat-shopping-list](https://github.com/jimpick/dat-shopping-list)

Dat Shopping List is a "Progressive Web App" built to demonstrate how to use the
new "multiwriter" capabalities that are being added to the [Dat Project](https://datproject.org/).

The demo is a simple "to do list" app, in the spirit of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project.

You can run it on any modern web browser. Also, you can run it on your mobile phone (iOS and Android), and it should work offline as well as online.
